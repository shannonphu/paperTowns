    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“Margo always loved mysteries. And in everything that came afterward, I could never stop thinking that maybe she loved mysteries so much that she became one.”</blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“The town was paper, but the memories were not.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“It is easy to forget how full the world is of people, full to bursting, and each of them imaginable and consistently misimagined.”</blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“Isn't it also that on some fundamental level we find it difficult to understand that other people are human beings in the same way that we are? We idealize them as gods or dismiss them as animals.”</blockquote></div>
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“That's always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people want to be around someone because they're pretty. It's like picking your breakfeast cereals based on color instead of taste.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“Maybe all the strings inside him broke.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“Isn't it also that on some fundamental level we find it difficult to understand that other people are human beings in the same way that we are? We idealize them as gods or dismiss them as animals.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“It was nice - in the dark and the quiet... and her eyes looking back, like there was something in me worth seeing.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“Poetry is just so emo." he said. "Oh, the pain. The pain. It always rains. In my soul.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“The rules of capitalization are so unfair to words in the middle of a sentence.” </blockquote></div>
    </div>

    <div id="q-block">
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“Leaving feels good and pure only when you leave something important, something that mattered to you. Pulling life out by the roots. But you can't do that until your life has grown roots.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“Just remember that sometimes, the way you think about a person isn’t the way they actually are… People are different when you can smell them and see them up close…” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“I stand in this parking lot, realizing that I’ve never been this far from home, and here is this girl I love and cannot follow. I hope this is the hero’s errand, because not following her is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“Imagining isn't perfect. You can't get all the way inside someone else...But imagining being someone else, or the world being something else, is the only way in. It is the machine that kills fascists.” ”</blockquote></div>
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“Traveling, I am finding, teaches you a lot of things about yourself. For instance, I never thought myself to be the kind of person who pees into a mostly empty bottle of Bluefin energy drink while driving through South Carolina at seventy-seven miles per hour - but in face I am that kind of person.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“I leave, and the leaving is so exhilarating I know I can never go back. But then what? Do I just keep leaving places, and leaving them, and leaving them, tramping a perpetual journey?” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“High school is neither a democracy nor a dictatorship - nor, contrary to popular belief, an anarchic state. High school is a divine-right monarchy. And when the queen goes on vacation, things change.”</blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“We imagine people as animals or gods. -But she was just a person, a girl.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q1"><blockquote>“The fundamental mistake I had always made - and that she had, in fairness, always led me to make - was this: Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventure. She was not a fine and precious thing. She was a girl.” </blockquote></div>
    <div class="q2"><blockquote>“My heart is really pounding," I said. <br>
"That's how you know you're having fun," Margo said.” </blockquote></div>
